# Fuzzware samples

This directory contains a subset of the firmware samples used in the evaluation of [Fuzzware](https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity22/presentation/scharnowski).
More specifically, all firmware samples newly created for the Fuzzware paper can be found here, while samples taken from other work for comparison purposes are excluded (as they would be redundant with parts of the monolithic-firmware-collection repository).

All samples, alongside with more details about them, can be found in the [fuzzware-experiments](https://github.com/fuzzware-fuzzer/fuzzware-experiments) repository.
